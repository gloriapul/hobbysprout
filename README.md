# HobbySprout 
[6.104 Portfolio](https://github.com/gloriapul/61040-portfolio)

A hobby motivation tool. This implementation focuses on the core concept of breaking down one's hobbies into smaller and more manageable tasks. 

## Concept: Milestones[User, Hobby]

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **TypeScript** (will be installed automatically)
- **Google Gemini API Key** (free at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

## Quick Setup

### 0. Clone the repo locally and navigate to it
```cd intro-gemini-schedule```

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Add Your API Key

**Why use a template?** The `config.json` file contains your private API key and should never be committed to version control. The template approach lets you:
- Keep the template file in git (safe to share)
- Create your own `config.json` locally (keeps your API key private)
- Easily set up the project on any machine

**Step 1:** Copy the template file:
```bash
cp config.json.template config.json
```

**Step 2:** Edit `config.json` and add your API key:
```json
{
  "apiKey": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

**To get your API key:**
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the key and paste it into `config.json` (replacing `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE`)

### 3. Run the Application

**Run all test cases:**
```bash
npm start
```

**Run specific test cases:**
```bash
npm run manual    # Manual scheduling only
npm run llm       # LLM-assisted scheduling only
npm run mixed     # Mixed manual + LLM scheduling
```

## File Structure

```
dayplanner/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json              # Dependencies and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json             # TypeScript configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ config.json               # Your Gemini API key
â”œâ”€â”€ dayplanner-types.ts       # Core type definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ dayplanner.ts             # DayPlanner class implementation

â”œâ”€â”€ dayplanner-tests.ts       # Test cases and examples
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/                     # Compiled JavaScript output
â””â”€â”€ README.md                 # This file
```

## Test Cases

The application includes three comprehensive test cases:

### 1. Manual Scheduling
Demonstrates adding activities and manually assigning them to time slots:

```typescript
const planner = new DayPlanner();
const breakfast = planner.addActivity('Breakfast', 1); // 30 minutes
planner.assignActivity(breakfast, 14); // 7:00 AM
```

### 2. LLM-Assisted Scheduling
Shows AI-powered scheduling with hardwired preferences:

```typescript
const planner = new DayPlanner();
planner.addActivity('Morning Jog', 2);
planner.addActivity('Math Homework', 4);
await llm.requestAssignmentsFromLLM(planner);
```

### 3. Mixed Scheduling
Combines manual assignments with AI assistance for remaining activities.

## Sample Output

```
ðŸ“… Daily Schedule
==================
7:00 AM - Breakfast (30 min)
8:00 AM - Morning Workout (1 hours)
10:00 AM - Study Session (1.5 hours)
1:00 PM - Lunch (30 min)
3:00 PM - Team Meeting (1 hours)
7:00 PM - Dinner (30 min)
9:00 PM - Evening Reading (1 hours)

ðŸ“‹ Unassigned Activities
========================
All activities are assigned!
```

## Key Features

- **Simple State Management**: Activities and assignments stored in memory
- **Flexible Time System**: Half-hour slots from midnight (0-47)
- **Query-Based Display**: Schedule generated on-demand, not stored sorted
- **AI Integration**: Hardwired preferences in LLM prompt (no external hints)
- **Conflict Detection**: Prevents overlapping activities
- **Clean Architecture**: First principles implementation with no legacy code

## LLM Preferences (Hardwired)

The AI uses these built-in preferences:
- Exercise activities: Morning (6:00 AM - 10:00 AM)
- Study/Classes: Focused hours (9:00 AM - 5:00 PM)
- Meals: Regular intervals (breakfast 7-9 AM, lunch 12-1 PM, dinner 6-8 PM)
- Social/Relaxation: Evenings (6:00 PM - 10:00 PM)
- Avoid: Demanding activities after 10:00 PM

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not load config.json"
- Ensure `config.json` exists with your API key
- Check JSON format is correct

### "Error calling Gemini API"
- Verify API key is correct
- Check internet connection
- Ensure API access is enabled in Google AI Studio

### Build Issues
- Use `npm run build` to compile TypeScript
- Check that all dependencies are installed with `npm install`

## Next Steps

Try extending the DayPlanner:
- Add weekly scheduling
- Implement activity categories
- Add location information
- Create a web interface
- Add conflict resolution strategies
- Implement recurring activities
